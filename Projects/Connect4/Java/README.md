# Connect4 Java AI

This was my first AI so it includes a few minmax implementation errors and poorly optimized code.

The goal was to design an AI (an agent) to defeat the "EnemyAgent".

I went for a basic implementation of [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) which achived approx 80% against "EnemyAgent" at a depth of 5.

The current main class runs 1000 games and logs the outcome.
